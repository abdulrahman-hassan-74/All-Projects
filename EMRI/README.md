# A New Era in MRI: Leveraging Earth's Magnetic Field for Diagnostic Imaging

## Introduction
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely used and effective imaging technique for visualizing soft tissues. Despite its success, conventional MRI faces challenges such as:
- Prolonged scan times.
- Strict safety precautions.
- High costs and limited accessibility.

This project explores the innovative potential of using **Earth's magnetic field** for ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI, challenging traditional assumptions about the dependence of image quality on magnetic field strength.

## Key Concept: Breaking the Conventional Law
### Formula: 
\[
P \propto \frac{B}{kT}
\]
Where:
- **P**: Degree of nuclear spin alignment (image quality indicator).
- **B**: Magnetic field strength.
- **k**: Boltzmann's constant.
- **T**: Temperature.

By assuming that **P** does not depend on **B**, it becomes possible to utilize Earth's magnetic field to align hydrogen atoms, achieving MRI imaging without high-strength magnets. This approach radically simplifies MRI systems.

## Benefits
1. **Affordability**: Reduces the cost of MRI systems significantly.
2. **Safety**: Enables imaging for patients with metallic implants.
3. **Accessibility**:
   - Portable and lightweight systems.
   - Claustrophobic patients can undergo scans more comfortably.

## Challenges and Considerations

### 1. System Design
- **Challenge**: Develop a lightweight, portable, and energy-efficient MRI system.
- **Consideration**: Balance simplicity and performance to ensure scalability.

### 2. Electromagnetic Interference
- **Challenge**: Earth's magnetic field is affected by electronic devices, power lines, and geomagnetic variations.
- **Consideration**: Implement effective shielding or real-time noise cancellation technologies.
